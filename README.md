# 🏡 Real Estate Analysis – King County Housing Data

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the **King County Housing Dataset** (Seattle area, USA) to uncover key insights for **buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts**.
The analysis explores affordability, pricing strategies, renovation ROI, and location-based premiums, while also developing **predictive models** to estimate house prices.

The goal is to provide **data-driven recommendations** to help:

* **Buyers** find affordable and value-for-money properties.
* **Sellers** maximize returns by optimizing pricing and highlighting high-value features.
* **Agents/Analysts** understand market trends for better decision-making.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) – Data wrangling & preprocessing
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning models (Random Forest, Linear Regression)
* **Jupyter/Google Colab** – Interactive analysis

---

## 📊 Key Insights

### For Buyers

* **Affordable Areas:** Zip codes like `98002`, `98032`, and `98030` are the most budget-friendly.
* **Best Value Homes:** Houses in the **2000–2500 sqft** range provide the lowest cost per square foot.
* **Property Condition & Age:** Well-maintained older homes (21–60 years) offer strong value.
* **Location Features:** Waterfront properties carry a **70%+ premium**; excellent views add up to **200% premium**.

### For Sellers

* **High-Value Features:** Construction **grade**, square footage, and bathrooms are most correlated with higher prices.
* **Optimal Timing:** **Spring & Summer (April–July)** are the best months to sell, with **June as peak**.
* **Renovations ROI:** Renovated homes, especially older ones, sell for **30–60% more**.
* **Basements:** Finished basements increase value, particularly for mid-sized homes (1500–2500 sqft).

## 🤖 Predictive Modeling

1. **Buyer Price Prediction Model (Random Forest):**

   * Helps buyers estimate fair prices and detect undervalued properties.
   * Achieved strong performance with **high R² and low error rates**.

2. **Seller Pricing Model (Linear Regression):**

   * Assists sellers in setting optimal listing prices.
   * Generates **conservative, recommended, and aggressive price ranges** for properties.
